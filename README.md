Convert the following UI design to a responsive HTML + CSS

Please use a free font and placeholder images instead of the one used in the design.
The layout and the alignment instead should be as close as possibile to the design.
Design is only provided for desktop devices; for mobile and tablet please adjust it as you think is most appropriate.

No UI javascript logic is needed here, just HTML markup and styles.
